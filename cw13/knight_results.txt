Searching for 6x6 solutions takes a very long time, so I've decided to include
results in this file. 
For time purposes I've only checked half of the board, since the situation on
the other side will be symmetrical. An even smarter solution could be used - we
only need to check about an eight of a board, like that:

X o o o o o
X X o o o o
X X X o o o
o o o o o o
o o o o o o
o o o o o o

Where X's are fields to be checked, o's can be omitted.

Our program output: 
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1]
[1, 1]
[1]


If we were to place these results on a board like before, it would look like this:

X X X X X X 
X X X X X o
X X X X o o 
X X X o o o
X X o o o o
X o o o o o

As the knight are symmetrical, we can extrapolate from this data, that all
starting points for board 6x6 have a solution. 

Example solution for starting point (0, 0).
